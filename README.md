# Amanda's Portfolio

Here I will present a number of different online courses that I have been doing, with examples of what I have been learning.

Different lines of codes, types of graphs, and languages will be displayed to give an overview of my knowledge.

## [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/afclopes/Start-Website/blob/master/_includes/03-Markdown.md)
**Created a cheatsheet to be able to reference to which will allow for easily adding the newst developments to this page**

Includes tricks for:
- headers
- lists
- quotes
- representing lines of code

## [Making a GitHub Page](https://github.com/afclopes/Start-Website/blob/master/_includes/02-GitHubPages.md)
**Description of how to create a GitHub Page**

Includes step by step guide for putting your page online.

## [Learning basics of SQL](https://github.com/afclopes/SQL_learning/blob/master/Getting_Started_in_SQL_live_Student.ipynb)
**Discovering statements necessary to query a dataset**

Includes statements such as:
- SELECT
- FROM
- WHERE, HAVING, BETWEEN
- LIMIT
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- ROUND, DISTINCT
- OR, AND
- JOIN, ON
And also shows how to use artimethics and equality signs like:
- LIKE, ILIKE, NOT LIKE, '%a', 'dat_'
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=!`, `=`
- `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, `avg()`, `count()`

3. [DataCamp Module 3](https://github.com/afclopes/SQL_learning/blob/master/Introduction_to_SQL_MOD3.md)
4. [DataCamp Module 4](https://github.com/afclopes/SQL_learning/blob/master/Introduction_to_SQL_MOD4.md)

## [Python Basics](https://github.com/afclopes/Python_DataCamp_Course/blob/master/webinar_content_students%20(1).ipynb)
**Covering the basics of Python**

Includes:
- Data types: integers, floats, boolean, string
- Aggreagted data types: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Data frames: joining, selecting with loc[] and iloc[], creating new, calculating with columns, indexing
- Loops: for, while, if, else, elif
- Functions: using, creating
- Reading files
- Using libraries: pandas, numpy

##[Data Visualisation in Python]()
**Investigates data by plotting information in different manners**
Uses python libraries like matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

Includes plotting in the following ways:
- Bar plot
- Line plot
- 

Also involves more detailed aesthetics like labelling x-axis and y-axis, title.

Some plots created for visualisation:
